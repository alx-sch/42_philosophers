 - t_sleep:		Time in milliseconds a philosopher sleeps after eating.
 - t_think:		Philosophers are altruistic in this simulation, meaning they delay
				taking forks and eating for as long as possible without starving.
				This behavior helps keep every philosopher alive as long as
				possible, especially when there's an odd number of philosophers:
				t_think = t_die - t_eat - t_sleep.
 - max_meals:	Max. number of meals a philosopher can eat before they stop
 				dining; `-1` means unlimited meals.

 				of meals (if specified) and have stopped eating.

 - t_start_sim:	Timestamp in milliseconds for when the simulation started.
 - forks:		Array of forks available for the philosophers.
 - philos:		Array of philosophers participating in the simulation.
 - mtx_print:	Mutex for synchronizing output to the console (printing).
 - mtx_print_init:	Flag checking if 'print' mutex has been initialized.
 - mtx_full_philos:	Mutex for checking / increasing 'full_philos'.
 - mtx_full_philos_init:	Flag checking if 'full_philos' mutex has been
 							initialized.
