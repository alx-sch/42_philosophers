/**
Prints the action of a philosopher with a timestamp, ensuring thread-safe access
to the standard output using a mutex.

The `update_timestamp` flag helps prevent timestamp mix-ups in multithreaded
execution by recalculating the timestamp just before printing.

Depending on the `EMOJI` and `FULL` flags (defined during compilation), the
function will print additional visual cues and information (default: no emojis
or additional info).

The timestamp is rounded to the nearest `ROUND` milliseconds (also defined during
compilation) before being printed to enhance readability (default: no rounding).

 @param timestamp 	The timestamp of the action in milliseconds.
 @param philo 		A pointer to the philosopher structure performing the action.
 @param action 		The action being performed, represented as an enum type:
					- FORK_L:	Takes their left fork.
					- FORK_R:	Takes their right fork.
					- EAT:		Starts eating.
					- SLEEP:	Starts sleeping.
					- THINK:	Starts thinking.
					- DIE: 		Has died.
					- STUFFED:	Has eaten all their meals.
 @param update_timestamp 	`0`: Use the provided timestamp as is;
							`1`: Recalculate the timestamp just before printing.

 @return			`0` if the action was printed successfully;
 					`1` if there was an error in locking or unlocking the mutex.
